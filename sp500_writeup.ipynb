    "# S&P 500 Analysis with Interactive Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is the analysis of S&P 500 data gathered from 1985 to 2022. I have chosen to do this to enhance my portfolio of data analysis projects, focussing on finance. I take in a `.csv` file to clean and work with the data to create visuals, calculate technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD), and create an interactive dashboard with my findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the \"S&P 500 Stocks\" dataset which I found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/sp-500-stocks), on kaggle, which can be implemented into your code through importing kaggle into your script or by reading the CSV file, which is the method I chose to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains information on the daily open prices, daily close prices, highs, lows and volume of the S&P 500 on the first of every month between 01/01/1985 and 01/09/2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `load_data.py`, I created a function `read_csv(csv)` which takes in one argument (a `.csv` file), to create a dataframe from the passed in file through using the Pandas library. I then clean the data accordingly, removing the unwanted column, namely \"Adj Close\", changing the date column to the desired format, casting any float-valued entries to have the datatype of a float, and finally removing any unwanted, non-numeric characters from the floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above python file could be adapted to accomodate for other ways datasets might be presented for example, a function to take in a database, or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `main.py`, after cleaning the data, I began to check for any empty values or duplicates and dealing with them accordingly. Nicely, in this dataset, there were no empty values or duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view the first 5 rows of the data from the csv file to look at what we have to work with:"

I calculate these in a script called `indicators.py` with functions `sma_indicator(df, 20, 50)`, `rsi_indicator(df, 14)`, `macd_indicator(df)`; they take in the data, aswell as the specified periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMA is calculated by taking the sum of the closing prices in a given day range, and dividing it by the number of days in the range. The example used here is between days 20 and 50. So, both `SMA_20` and `SMA_50` tell you the average price over the last 20 and 50 days respectively. The choice of 20 and 50 days give you a view of both short and medium term trends of the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSI is used to determine when a stock has been overbought or oversold. In my project I use the RSI to determine exactly this, presenting the days in which the S&P 500 is oversold or overbought.\n",
    "Normally, the RSI is calculated through the formula \n",
    "$$\\text{RSI} = 100 - \\frac{100}{1-\\text{rs}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{rs}$ is the average gain / average loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MACD is used to potentially signal when to buy or sell. In my scripts I use calculations to see when the S&P 500 is bullish or bearish, creating new columns in the dataframe to show these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A snippet of the table after calculating these technical indicators can be seen below. As an example, I chose 5 random rows from the year 2015."

    "To present my findings I've made a custom interactive dashboard, which can be found [here](https://sp500-analysis-kmhutxnyuhr5bljphbk8ym.streamlit.app/), through the use of the streamlit library in Python. It displays a quick preview of the data in a table, has a year slider so the user can choose their preferred year range they want to look at and 4 individual plots of:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates my skills in Python and SQL with libraries `pandas` and `streamlit`, as well as `mplfinance` for visualising my findings. It also showcases my understanding of financial data and how to communicate results clearly through the use of a dashboard.\n",
